This project is a clone of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. It's designed to demonstrate full-stack capabilities using a diverse set of modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store application data.
- **Prisma**: A next-generation database ORM used for easy data access and manipulation.
- **bcrypt**: A password-hashing function designed to build a cryptographically secure hash of user passwords.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Leaflet**: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

... and many more.

## Purpose and Goal

The purpose of this project was to test myself as a developer while showcase my full-stack abilities by recreating a complex, real-world application like Airbnb. It focuses on both the backend (database interactions, authentication, and server-side logic) and the frontend (creating a user-friendly interface, interactive maps, and responsive design).
